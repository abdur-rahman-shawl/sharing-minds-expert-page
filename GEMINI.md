# Project Overview

This is a Next.js project for a landing page called "SharingMinds". It's designed to attract experts to join as mentors. The project is built with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses a component-based architecture with a significant number of UI components from `radix-ui` and `lucide-react`.

The main page is composed of several sections: a hero section, a benefits section, a testimonial section, a final call-to-action section, and a footer.
